Global:
- Rethink and possibly add verification of output buffer lengths.
  In other words check whether the user won't cause a buffer overflow.
- Support for OCB mode was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0
- We need a way to import keys encrypted with hw (or other) keys. New
  function like yaca_key_load or sth?
- Add extended description and examples in documentation.
