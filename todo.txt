Global:
- Rethink and possibly add verification of output buffer lengths.
  In other words check whether the user won't cause a buffer overflow.
- Importing/exporting encrypted (passphrased) RSA keys
- Support for OCB mode was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0
- Remove debug function from examples
- yaca_key_wrap(), yaca_key_unwrap()
- We need a way to import keys encrypted with hw (or other) keys. New
  function like yaca_key_load or sth?
- Add extended description and examples in documentation.
- Check PKCS8 with PKCS5 2.0 (EVP cipher instead of PBE)
